Supplementary data

The repo contains a ready-to-use file "KASP.str" in STRUCTURE format with KASP loci genotypes of hemolymph (H) and foot (F) tissues of _Mtr_ BTN-infected mussels (marked with BTN prefix) and healthy mussels from the GR3 and CH1 samples. _M. trossulus_ specific alleles are coded as "1", _M. edulis/M. galloprovincialis_ specific alleles are coded as "2", the missing data marked by "?". The taxonomic affinity of GR3 mussels identified by preliminary allozyme analysis is indicated by prefixes: ME - _M. edulis_, MT - _M. trossulus_, HYBR - hybrids.
