Supplementary data

The repo contains a ready-to-use file "KASP.str" in STRUCTURE format with KASP loci genotypes of hemolymph (H) and foot (F) tissues of _Mtr_ BTN-infected mussels (marked with BTN prefix) and healthy mussels from the GR3 and CH1 samples. The putative population origin of individuals is indicated in the file. The number of individuals is 114, the number of loci is 5. _M. trossulus_ specific alleles are coded as "1", _M. edulis_ specific alleles are coded as "2", the missing data marked by "-9". The taxonomic affinity of GR3 mussels identified by preliminary allozyme analysis is indicated by prefixes: ME - _M. edulis_, MT - _M. trossulus_, HYBR - hybrids.
